# FAQ

Q: Where do I put the configuration files that are sent me?

A: We recommend creating a *new, empty folder* and put your private and
public keys (gen2_connect and gen2_connect.pub) in there.
When we send you the configuration files for your observation, put them
also in this folder.

You will normally want to operate g2remote out of this folder unless you
have modified the config file to change the paths (not recommended).
i.e. you should "cd" to this folder before running the g2connect command.

**Do not put the private key and configuration files in the source code
(git clone) folder for g2remote--use a separate folder**.

Q: When can I test my connection before observation?

A: Your key will be inserted by approximately 10:30 HST (5:30 JST,
20:30 UTC) on the starting day of your observation run.  You can test
anytime between then and 17:00 HST.  Normally, a test takes only a few
minutes following the instructions in the "operation" document.

***After testing, disconnect and consult with your support astronomer
or the Subaru operator about when to connect again for your observation***.

***If you don't test your connection before 17:00 HST on the night of
your observation, troubleshooting and help may be limited from the
observatory side.***

Q: Can I use g2connect with a VPN?
